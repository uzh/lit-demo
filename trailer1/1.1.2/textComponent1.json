  "markdownContent": "You also wonder about Professor Parrenas's conclusion that “our skills have not been sufficiently utilized.” What skills does she mean? Here you are, sitting in the university library late on a Tuesday afternoon, while sane people working in offices and businesses are finishing up before a night of friendship and good food in celebration of tomorrow’s national holiday. You have very little money (at least by student standards), nor indeed much to celebrate. For you are nowhere near finishing up your Master's thesis (despite what you have told Professor Witles about your solid progress). Your life, with approximately only 50 EUR in the bank before an upcoming meeting with your bank manager on Thursday, is economising--including with the truth.<br><br>This was not what you had in mind when you started as a graduate student, nor when you proposed your thesis's working title. “Transgressive Women, Transnational Work”: what intellectual ambition! What an invitation to travel, perhaps even back to Japan! But it turns out that research trips aren’t that straightforward: money doesn’t grow on broccoli florets, as Witles is fond of saying. And nor, it seems, do ideas."
