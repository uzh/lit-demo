  "markdownContent": "The comment you added to your Notebook sums up how you felt---and continue to feel!---about the whole academic exercise right now. Nevertheless, the trained researcher in you is a bit shocked by the fact that you didn't properly note down the relevant bibliographic details. Your standards are slipping! You vaguely remember Putnam's article was in a journal called *The American Historical Review*. Open a new tab in your browser and search online for it. Then copy and paste the URL to Putnam's article into your Notebook. Add the article abstract, too---and skim *The American Historical Review*'s table of contents for the issue in which Putnam's article appeared. Your Notebook entries will be saved when you press “Continue”, and at any point in the game you'll be able to download them as a PDF file. (If you are playing this topic as part of a class assignment, your teacher will be able to see your Notebook entries at the end of the game.)"
