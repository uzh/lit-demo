  "body": "Sorry, forgot to forward this from GLAMM! Just FYI<br><br>-----<br><br>*The modern world is a world of movement. Men moved. Women moved. Children moved. And they all carried the culture of clothes when they moved: clothes in motion, motion in clothes. “Kimonos, Labour and Migration” will trace the metamorphosis of the iconic Japanese kimono during the mass migrations of the nineteenth century, from formal wear to field garment, from woodblock print to photograph, from teenage bride to grandmother, from hope to memory, from trunk to closet, and--last but not least--from home to museum. Like the patterns on the kimonos, the patterns of history can be read into these garments: the past in the fabric, the fabric of the past.*<br><br>Speak soon,<br>Nat"
