  "markdownContent": "It's a funny coincidence that you got an email from Natalie just now. She's a postdoc in the Department of History and her expertise is in modern Japan. You remember a presentation she once gave in Professor Witles's colloquium where she talked about a similar map to the Edo one. Her point was that the four cardinal directions in such maps are usually presented as relative to the position of the map-reader. You remind yourself of what the four cardinal directions are in Japanese by looking them up online. Now identify which of the four letters (A, B, C or D) corresponds to “north” on the map---which you can enlarge if you want."
