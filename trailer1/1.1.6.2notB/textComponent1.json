  "markdownContent": "Natalie's point had been this: in such maps, the text and symbols are displayed relative to the position of the reader. Here, the character for west (è¥¿) appears upside down, at the top of the map. If you had been arriving in Edo from the west (perhaps like Tsuneno in 1839) and trying to read the map, you would have had to rotate it 180 degrees from how it appears here. And, once you'd done that, you would have seen the Japanese characters for the shogun's castle, in the map's centre, the right way up. Similarly, many of the characters in Edo bay have been written so as to be readable if you were approaching the city by ship.<br><br>After Natalie's presentation, Professor Witles had made a comment about situational perspectives being a metaphor for academic research. He evidently meant this as a joke, for he had laughed loudly afterwards."
