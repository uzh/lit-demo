I don't know if you got my email, but the Director of GLAMM suddenly got in touch earlier today. They've got a new exhibition coming up on kimonos and migration. Yes, the abstract I sent you is certainly uniquely written. But the student researcher they had helping them is incapacitated for some reason, and they're looking for a replacement. You know they're a bit quirky at the museum but the work is probably pretty interesting. And they pay well, or so I hear.<br><br>“The only issue is, they want to employ someone immediately, which means an interview tomorrow. Yes, yes, it's a national holiday, but as a global museum they claim they are above such things. And the work requires you to travel, too. I'm not sure how Witles will feel about that. He thinks you're *way* more advanced with your Master's than you really are, you know. So even if you were to tell him you're going away for “archival” work while actually doing museum duties, he might be unconvinced. What do you think? Shall I tell the museum you'll come for a job interview tomorrow morning?”",
