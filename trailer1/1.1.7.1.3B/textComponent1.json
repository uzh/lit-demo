  "markdownContent": "Director van Dijk comes in to check on your progress. He idly places some books on a table behind you and then stands by the window, apparently lost in thought. It doesn't quite seem like the right time to ask him more about the research article from which the photo was taken, or about the photo itself. Through the open door back into the museum rooms, you see once more the detritus of an exhibition space coming to life: drills dismissed, storage boxes open, draft texts on the wall.<br><br>But will this world open to you? If you get it, will a job offer from GLAMM help spark new research ideas? What travel will be involved, and will you have to down tools to go? Will you be able to look your bank manager in the eye tomorrow and tell her not to worry? Or will you be consigned to library research and fobbing Prof Witles off about the progress of your MA?<br><br>Join us when *Lives in Transit* is launched in spring 2020 to find out... And in the meantime, you can download your notes and sources either by opening your Notebook now and clicking on the download icon, or by clicking on the icon you'll see under “Finished Games” once you leave this page and go to the “Your Games” menu."
