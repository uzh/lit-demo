  "markdownContent": "As you are enjoying Stanley's work so much, you decide to look up her book, *Selling Women: Prostitution, Markets, and the Household in Early Modern Japan*. Fortuitously, your university library has a copy. And so you do that most rare thing in this digital age: you leave the cafe and go to the bookshelves.<br><br>The history collection is stored in the lower basement floor (B-1), which of course has nothing to do with how your university president rates the discipline of history. So you descend several staircases until you reach a door on which someone has scribbled a makeshift sign: “Hades -1”. And there, after some initial confusion, you finally locate Stanley's book. As you take it off the shelf, you notice several other monographs around it: *Sanitized Sex: Regulating Prostitution, Venereal Disease, and Intimacy in Occupied Japan, 1945-1952*, and *Sex in Japan's Globalization, 1870-1930: Prostitutes, Emigration and Nation-Building*, and *Ah Ku and Karayuki-San: Prostitution in Singapore, 1870-1940*.<br><br>Not having any idea what “Ah Ku” or “Karayuki-San” refer to, you take the latter off the shelf---and are immediately struck by its frontcover. Here's one thing you don't get when you search online catalogues: the way the library's harsh ceiling lights reflect off the woman's face, so that your own features layer onto hers. Or the way the book's weight---at more than 400 pages---seems to lie behind her portrait, giving heft to her history."
