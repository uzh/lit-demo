  "markdownContent": "“The majority of women were smuggled overseas on coal ships plying the route between Nagasaki and Shanghai. Sailors whose steamers regularly berthed in Kobe or Nagasaki were often bribed by *zegen* into taking girls on board as stowaways. From Shanghai they generally went first to Hong Kong where they spent some time in the brothels, and were required to learn some English. After a short stay in the colony often of several months’ duration, the girls were again stowed aboard as secret passengers in the hold of a ship and taken southward to Singapore. Increasing recognition of the extent of this organized traffic to Singapore was reflected in the frequency with which the phrase “illegal female emigrants” began to appear in newspapers in Fukuoka prefecture. The girls who had been purchased or kidnapped in Japan and smuggled in the bilge or coal bunkers of steamships without proper passports or documents were sold at the wharf to brothel-keepers as soon as they landed in Singapore. The price of an attractive young woman could be as much as 2,000 yen once lodging and transportation costs were calculated.”<br>Warren, *Ah Ku and Karayuki-san: Prostitution in Singapore, 1870-1940* (1993), p.83."
